# MaxRectDetection
This Python script processes grayscale images to find and visualize the largest rectangle in a binary matrix. Using OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib, it converts the image to a binary matrix, calculates the largest rectangle's area and corners, and then draws and displays the rectangle on the original image for easy analysis.
